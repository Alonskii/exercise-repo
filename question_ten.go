A potential issue in the snippet.go script is the incorrect data type used for the result variable in the factorial function. It is declared as an int, but assigned a value of 1.00, which is a floating-point number. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.

In order address this issue, we need to change the data type of result to int to match the return type of the factorial function, which is also int.
